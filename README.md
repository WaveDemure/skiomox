## Ok, but what is this???

  this is a Modded version of the skiovox-helper extension<br>
  the mod was made for fun by WaveDemure

## Features (v1.0.1m Beta Build)

*  Fix for most keyboard shortcuts
*  Added games
 - still in beta
 
## Ok, but a few questions

  * what does the "m" mean in the version<br>
     the "m" stands for mod/mox if you make a mod of this put "mm" in the main.js<br>

  * why are there few games<br>
     making a request for a game just put on in issues please dont make a PR<br>
