# Skiomox --- the moxxed skiovox helper

**Installation**

While in skiovox instead of using the un-moxxed (un-modded) version use this one

This extension:

- Fixes most shortcut functionality within the exploit
- Allows for resizing and dragging of windows
- Makes it easier to add Google accounts and use the Web Store within the exploit

*Note: You can exit fullscreen videos by pressing ctrl+T after you've set up the shortcuts*
